/*
The code you provided is a React context setup for managing the theme of your application. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. You import the necessary functions and modules from React:

   - `useState`: A hook for managing component state.
   - `createContext`: A function to create a new context.
   - `useContext`: A hook for consuming context values.

2. You create a new context called `ThemeContext` using the `createContext` function.

3. You define a component called `ThemeProvider` that takes a `children` prop. This component is responsible for providing the theme state to its child components.

4. Inside the `ThemeProvider` component, you use the `useState` hook to create a `theme` state variable with an initial value of "light" and a `setTheme` function to update it. This state represents the current theme of your application.

5. You wrap the child components in the `ThemeContext.Provider` component, passing the `theme` and `setTheme` as a value to the context. This allows child components to access and modify the theme state.

6. You define a custom hook called `useTheme`, which uses the `useContext` hook to consume the `ThemeContext`. This hook allows other components to access the current theme and the `setTheme` function.

7. Finally, you export the `useTheme` and `ThemeProvider` components so that they can be used in other parts of your application.

To use this theme context in your application, you can wrap your app with the `ThemeProvider` component at the top level. This will provide access to the theme state and setter function to all the components within your app. For example:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { ThemeProvider } from "./your-theme-provider-file"; // Replace with the correct file path

function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      { Your app content here }
      </ThemeProvider>
      );
    }
    
    export default App;
    ```
    
    Now, any component within your app can use the `useTheme` hook to access the current theme and change it as needed.
